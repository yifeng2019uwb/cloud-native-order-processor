"""
API Constants - Consolidated

Combines all API-related constants from multiple files:
- HTTP Status Codes (from http_status.py)
- API Response Descriptions (from api_responses.py)
- Error Messages (from error_messages.py)
- Request Headers (from request_headers.py)

This file provides a single source of truth for all API-related constants.
