Global Pagination Models for All Services

This file will contain pagination models that will be shared across all services.
Currently planned for future implementation.

Planned Models:
- PaginationRequest (limit, offset, cursor-based)
- PaginationResponse (total_count, has_next, has_previous)
- CursorPagination (for better performance with large datasets)

Services to be updated:
- user_service
- inventory_service
- order_service

Implementation Notes:
- Will be implemented in common package for consistency
- Will support both offset-based and cursor-based pagination
- Will include metadata for pagination state
- Will be consistent with industry standards

Status: Planned for future implementation when all services are ready for pagination standardization.
