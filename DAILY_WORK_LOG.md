  - **Zero Configuration**: New services just import BaseLogger and start logging
  - **Service Isolation**: Each service gets its own log file and directory automatically
  - **Automatic Labeling**: Service name automatically extracted as Prometheus label for easy querying

- **Service Integration Pattern**:
  ```python
  # For any new service, just do this:
  from services.common.src.logging import BaseLogger
  logger = BaseLogger("my_new_service", log_to_file=True)
  logger.info("service_started", "New service is running")
  ```

- **Log File Structure (Auto-Generated)**:
  ```
  logs/
  ├── services/
  │   ├── auth_service/          # Created when auth service starts
  │   │   └── auth_service.log
  │   ├── user_service/          # Created when user service starts
  │   │   └── user_service.log
  │   └── any_new_service/      # Created automatically for new services!
  │       └── any_new_service.log
  ```

- **Querying Benefits**:
  - **Service-Specific**: `{service="auth_service"}` for auth logs only
  - **Cross-Service**: `{user="john_doe"}` for user activity across all services
  - **Action-Based**: `{action="login"}` for all login events across services

### **8/14/2025 - Backend Critical Issues Investigation & Task Assignment**
**Focus**: Investigate and fix critical backend issues causing 500 errors in frontend

**🔍 Investigation Results:**
- [x] **Identified Root Cause of Asset Balance 500 Errors**
  - Gateway routing broken for `/api/v1/assets/balances` after August 9th changes
  - `getBasePath` function missing pattern for asset balance endpoint
  - Gateway sends `/balances` instead of `/assets/balances` to Order Service
  - Order Service expects `/assets/balances`, gets `/balances` → 500 Error

- [x] **Identified Asset Transaction Parameter Mismatch**
  - Controller calls `get_user_asset_transactions(username, asset_id, limit, offset)`
  - DAO method only accepts `get_user_asset_transactions(username, asset_id, limit)`
  - `offset` parameter causes 500 Internal Server Error
  - Frontend expects working pagination but gets server errors

- [x] **Identified Redundant Asset Transaction Endpoint**
  - Unnecessary `/assets/transactions/{username}/{asset_id}` endpoint exists
  - Duplicates functionality of clean `/assets/{asset_id}/transactions`
  - Creates security risk and maintenance overhead
  - No admin use case needed for personal project

- [x] **Identified JWT Security Enhancement Opportunity**
  - Current JWT expiry: 24 hours (too long for security)
  - Personal project doesn't need long-lived tokens
  - Simple change to 60 minutes would improve security
