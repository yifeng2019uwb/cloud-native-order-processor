## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Prerequisites**
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (Kind for local development)
- AWS CLI configured
- Node.js 18+ and Python 3.11+

### **1. Local Development (Recommended)**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd cloud-native-order-processor

# Use the new deployment script (recommended)
./scripts/deploy-docker.sh -bd all

# Access services
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Gateway: http://localhost:8080
# User Service: http://localhost:8000
# Inventory Service: http://localhost:8001
# Order Service: http://localhost:8002
```

### **2. Kubernetes Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy to local Kubernetes
./scripts/deploy.sh --type k8s --environment dev

# Access services
# Frontend: http://localhost:30004
# Gateway: http://localhost:30000
```

### **3. Component Development**
```bash
# Build and test individual components
./frontend/build.sh              # Frontend build & test
./gateway/build.sh               # Gateway build & test
./services/build.sh              # Services build & test

# Or use Makefile shortcuts
make build                       # Build all components
make test                        # Test all components
make deploy-k8s                  # Deploy to Kubernetes
```

## 🚀 Deployment Scripts

### **deploy-docker.sh** - **NEW!** 🎯
**Purpose**: Simple, consistent Docker deployment for development environment

**Usage**:
```bash
# Build + Deploy all services
./scripts/deploy-docker.sh -bd all

# Build + Deploy specific service
./scripts/deploy-docker.sh -bd frontend-dev
./scripts/deploy-docker.sh -bd user_service
./scripts/deploy-docker.sh -bd inventory_service
./scripts/deploy-docker.sh -bd order_service
./scripts/deploy-docker.sh -bd gateway

# Build only
./scripts/deploy-docker.sh -b frontend-dev

# Deploy only (uses existing images)
./scripts/deploy-docker.sh -d frontend-dev
```

**Features**:
- ✅ **Simple interface**: `-b` (build), `-d` (deploy), `-bd` (both)
- ✅ **Service selection**: Individual services or `all`
- ✅ **Development focused**: Uses `docker-compose.dev.yml`
