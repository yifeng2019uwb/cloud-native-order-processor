name: CI/CD Pipeline

# CI runs automatically (free) - tests and builds only
# Additional jobs can be enabled via environment variables
#
# HOW TO ENABLE JOBS:
# 1. Terraform Plan: Set ENABLE_TERRAFORM_PLAN=true in repository variables
# 2. Integration Tests: Set ENABLE_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true in repository variables
# 3. Terraform Apply: Set ENABLE_TERRAFORM_APPLY=true in repository variables
#
# To enable jobs:
# - Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Variables
# - Add repository variables with the names above
# - Set values to 'true' to enable, 'false' or leave unset to disable
#
# COST AWARENESS:
# - Test job: $0 (free)
# - Terraform Plan: $0 (free)
# - Integration Tests: ~$5-10 per run
# - Terraform Apply: ~$20-50/day ongoing
