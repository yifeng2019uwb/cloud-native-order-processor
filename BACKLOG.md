- **Component**: Security & API Gateway
- **Type**: Epic
- **Priority**: üî• **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- **Status**: üìã To Do

**Description:**
Implement centralized authentication architecture with a completely **independent Auth Service** that handles all JWT validation and user authentication, while the Gateway focuses on routing and request forwarding. This eliminates JWT secret distribution issues, improves security, and provides a clean separation of authentication concerns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  - [ ] Create new Auth Service directory and structure
  - [ ] Implement new Auth class with independent JWT validation logic
  - [ ] Create independent JWT configuration and secret management
  - [ ] Implement JWT validation and user context extraction
  - [ ] Set up internal communication endpoints
  - [ ] Test Auth Service standalone functionality
- [ ] **Phase 2: Gateway Integration Testing**
  - [ ] Integrate Auth Service with Gateway for authentication
  - [ ] Implement request forwarding to Auth Service
  - [ ] Add security header injection based on Auth Service response
  - [ ] Test Gateway-Auth Service integration
  - [ ] Validate complete authentication flow end-to-end
  - [ ] Ensure Gateway handles all request forwarding to backend services
- [ ] **Phase 3: Backend Service Cleanup**
  - [ ] Remove JWT validation from User Service
  - [ ] Remove JWT validation from Order Service

  - [ ] Test security measures and source validation
- [ ] **Phase 4: Common Package Cleanup**
  - [ ] Remove JWT-related code from common package
  - [ ] Remove JWT token manager and utilities
  - [ ] Remove JWT models and dependencies
  - [ ] Keep non-auth utilities (logging, configuration, etc.)
  - [ ] Test that remaining common package functionality works
- [ ] **Phase 5: Network Security Implementation**
  - [ ] Implement Kubernetes NetworkPolicy to restrict backend service access
  - [ ] Update services to bind only to internal cluster IPs

  - [ ] Integration testing with all services
  - [ ] Security audit and penetration testing
  - [ ] Network security testing to verify backend services reject external requests
  - [ ] End-to-end authentication flow testing
  - [ ] Performance impact validation
- [ ] **Phase 7: Deployment and Monitoring**
  - [ ] Production deployment of new auth architecture
  - [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup for auth system
  - [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization

- [ ] Network isolation ensures backend services not directly accessible
- [ ] Backend services only accept requests from internal cluster IPs

**Security Benefits:**
- [ ] Eliminates JWT secret distribution across services
- [ ] Centralizes security control and policies in dedicated Auth Service
