#### **SEC-005: Centralized Authentication Architecture Implementation**
- **Component**: Security & API Gateway
- **Type**: Epic
- **Priority**: üî• **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- **Status**: üìã To Do

**Description:**
Implement centralized authentication architecture with a dedicated **Auth Service** that handles all JWT validation and user authentication, while the Gateway focuses on routing and request forwarding. This eliminates JWT secret distribution issues, improves security, and provides a foundation for future RBAC implementation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  - [ ] Update common package to ensure JWT functionality is reusable
  - [ ] Implement JWT validation and user context extraction using common package
  - [ ] Set up internal communication with Gateway
  - [ ] Test authentication flows and JWT reuse strategy
- [ ] **Phase 2: Gateway Integration**
  - [ ] Update Gateway to use Auth Service for authentication
  - [ ] Implement request forwarding to Auth Service
  - [ ] Add security header injection based on Auth Service response
  - [ ] Test Gateway-Auth Service integration
  - [ ] Ensure Gateway handles all request forwarding to backend services
- [ ] **Phase 3: Backend Service Updates**
  - [ ] Remove JWT validation from User Service
  - [ ] Remove JWT validation from Order Service
