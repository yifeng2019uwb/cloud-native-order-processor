#### **FEATURE-002: AI Analysis / Insights (Option 1)** — _Part of demo_ 🔥 **PRIORITY #2**
- **Component**: Insights Service (new microservice)
- **Type**: New Feature
- **Priority**: 🔥 **HIGH** (Complete Quickly - Optional but Needs Completion)
- **Status**: 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**
- **Goal**: Add an endpoint that aggregates portfolio, orders, and price data, calls an external LLM API (Google Gemini), and returns a short text analysis for display in the UI.
- **Design doc**: **Optional** for this scope. A short design note (1–2 pages) is enough if you want to lock scope before coding or hand off to someone else. Use a full design doc if you need review, multiple implementers, or future extension. Suggested contents if you add one: scope (Option 1 only), endpoint contract (path, method, request/response), data flow (which services are called, payload to LLM), prompt strategy (system + user prompt, length limits), config (env vars, API key), error handling and timeouts.
- **Approach** (Option 1 – lightweight):
  - **Backend**: New API route (e.g. in user_service or gateway-proxied) that:
    1. Fetches user portfolio, recent orders, and current/market prices from existing services
    2. Builds a small JSON/text payload for the LLM
    3. Calls external LLM API (Google Gemini) with a fixed system + user prompt
    4. Returns the model's short analysis (e.g. 2–4 sentences) as JSON
  - **Frontend**: One new section or modal that calls this endpoint and displays the analysis text.
  - **Config**: API key via env var (`GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`); no new infra.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] New endpoint implemented and documented (`GET /api/v1/insights/portfolio`)
  - [x] Endpoint aggregates portfolio, orders, and price data from existing services
  - [x] LLM call is made with a bounded prompt; response is parsed and returned as structured JSON
  - [x] API key is read from environment; no keys in code
  - [x] Errors (missing key, LLM failure, timeout, rate limits) are handled and return clear HTTP/JSON responses
  - [x] Design doc created (`docs/design-docs/ai-insights-design.md`)
  - [x] **Deploy insights service** to Docker environment
  - [x] **Add gateway route** for insights endpoint
  - [x] **Happy case verified** - Endpoint returns 200 OK with valid response
  - [x] **Run integration tests** successfully (end-to-end verification)
  - [ ] **Frontend integration**: API client method, component for "Insights" or "AI Summary", and wiring to dashboard/profile _(**PAUSED**: local deploy needs extra config, causes issues — resume later)_
  - [ ] **Frontend can request and display** the analysis (e.g. on dashboard or profile)
- **Estimated time for this part**:
  - **Backend (endpoint + LLM integration)**: ~2–4 hours
  - **Frontend (call API + display)**: ~1–2 hours
  - **Testing + run-through for this feature**: ~1–2 hours
  - **Total for this part**: **~4–8 hours** (your full demo can include other flows as well).
- **Dependencies**: Existing user, order, inventory/price services; external LLM API key and SDK (e.g. `openai`, `anthropic`).
- **Files to add/update** (examples):
  - New route/handler in user_service (or dedicated insights module): e.g. `services/user_service/src/.../insights.py` and router registration
  - Gateway: proxy route for the new endpoint if needed
  - Frontend: new API client method, component for "Insights" or "AI Summary", and wiring to dashboard/profile
  - Config/env: document new env var(s) for LLM API key
- **Demo assistance**: Yes — an AI assistant can help with this part and with the full demo once it's in place: e.g. scripted flow for the AI insights step, plus talking points and narrative for the rest of your demo. Share your running endpoints (and optionally a Postman/curl one-pager), and the assistant can suggest exact requests, UI clicks, and narrative.

#### **CNY-001: Chinese New Year Secret — 恭喜发财，红包拿来** 🧧 ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Component**: Frontend + Backend (Gateway or User Service)
- **Type**: Easter Egg / Fun Feature
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** — See DAILY_WORK_LOG.md
- **Scope**:
  - **Backend**: ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Frontend**: ✅ COMPLETED
    - [x] Hidden 🧧 button in Dashboard footer (`CnyTrigger`)
    - [x] Modal with form (`CnyClaimModal`) — phrase input, submit, error display
    - [x] Call `POST /api/v1/cny/claim` via `cnyApi.ts`
    - [x] Success UI — big/small red pocket images (`bigrpocket.jpg`, `littleredpocket.jpg`), amount at bottom (avoids covering god's face)
    - [x] Animation removed (attempts did not run; user opted to skip)

#### **DEMO-001: Project Demo — Full Workflow & All Existing APIs** 🔥 **PRIORITY #6**
- **Component**: Demo / Documentation
- **Type**: Demo Preparation & Delivery
- **Priority**: 🔥 **HIGH**
- **Status**: 📋 **To Do**
- **Goal**: Demo this project end-to-end: show how the project works using **all existing APIs** and the **whole workflow** (auth → user → portfolio → orders → inventory/prices, gateway, frontend).
- **Scope**:
  - **All existing APIs**: Auth (login/register/token), User (profile, portfolio), Order (place/list), Inventory (assets, prices), Gateway as single entry, plus any other live endpoints.
  - **Whole workflow**: End-to-end flow showing how a user signs in, views portfolio, sees prices, places an order, and how services interact (e.g. gateway → backend services, frontend ↔ API).
  - **Optional part**: FEATURE-002 (AI Analysis / Insights) 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Demo script or runbook that walks through the full workflow with running services
  - [ ] All major existing APIs exercised and explained (auth, user, portfolio, orders, inventory/prices)
  - [ ] Clear narrative for how the project works (architecture, request flow, data flow)
  - [ ] Demo can be delivered live (or recorded) using your running service(s)
  - [ ] Optional: One-pager (e.g. Postman collection or curl/UI steps) for reproducibility
- **Deliverables** (examples):
  - Demo script / talking points (step-by-step flow)
  - List of APIs and order of calls for the workflow
  - Optional: Short doc or checklist (“How this project works” for the demo)
- **Dependencies**: Running services (local or deployed); FEATURE-002 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**
- **Demo assistance**: An AI assistant can help create the script, API order, and narrative once you share how you run the project (e.g. `dev.sh`, endpoints, frontend URL). No code change required—this task is about **preparing and delivering** the demo with existing APIs and workflow.

#### **SEC-010: Incident Response Simulation — Failed-Login Runbook** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Component**: Security Operations / Documentation
- **Type**: Runbook & Security Ops
- **Priority**: 📋 **MEDIUM**
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** — Runbook: `docs/runbooks/failed-login-burst.md`. Trigger: 5 failed logins from same IP in 1 day. Steps: verify (Loki/audit, gateway logs) → containment (auto-block or manual redis-cli) → evidence → follow-up. See DAILY_WORK_LOG.md.


#### **SEC-011: IP Block in Gateway** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Component**: Gateway (Go) / Security
- **Type**: Implementation
- **Priority**: 📋 **MEDIUM**
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** — Auth middleware checks Redis `ip_block:<ip>` (403 if blocked). Gateway records failed logins; after 5 in 1-day window sets block. Integration tests: init → 5 wrong logins → 403 → wait 5 min → login works. See DAILY_WORK_LOG.md, `integration_tests/incident/README.md`.

#### **INFRA-022: Remove Kubernetes Scaling & Load Balancing Features (Discussion)**
- **Component**: Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Type**: Architecture Simplification / Discussion
- **Priority**: 📋 **UNDER DISCUSSION** (No decision made)
- **Status**: 💬 **DISCUSSION**
- **Goal**: Evaluate removing scaling and load balancing features from Kubernetes/Terraform configuration to simplify the project for personal project scale. Focus on security features (rate limiting, circuit breakers) rather than scalability.
- **Current State Analysis**:
  - **Terraform EKS (`terraform/eks.tf`)**:
    - Node group autoscaling: `desired_size = 2`, `max_size = 3`, `min_size = 1` (lines 32-36)
    - AWS Network Load Balancer for API Gateway (lines 49-107) with target group and health checks
    - Adds complexity and cost for personal project
  - **Kubernetes Kind Config (`kubernetes/kind-config.yaml`)**:
    - Multi-node cluster: 1 control-plane + 2 worker nodes
    - Overkill for personal project testing
  - **Kubernetes Deployments**:
    - All monitoring services: `replicas: 1` (Loki, Promtail, Grafana) ✅ Already simple
    - Redis: `replicas: 1` ✅ Already simple
  - **Gateway Code**:
    - Single URL per service (no load balancing logic) ✅ Already simple
    - Matches simplified approach
- **Discussion Points**:
  - **Why Remove?**:
    - Personal project focus: Security features (rate limits, circuit breakers) more important than scalability
    - Hard to test/validate scaling features in personal project context
    - Don't want to maintain autoscaling/load balancing complexity
    - Lower cost: No load balancer, fewer nodes
    - Easier debugging: Single instance per service
  - **What to Remove/Simplify?**:
    1. **Terraform EKS Node Group Autoscaling**:
       - Remove `scaling_config` block OR set fixed size: `desired_size = 1`, `max_size = 1`, `min_size = 1`
       - Simplifies node management
    2. **AWS Network Load Balancer**:
       - Remove `aws_lb.api_gateway`, `aws_lb_target_group.api_gateway`, `aws_lb_listener.api_gateway`
       - Use NodePort or ClusterIP + port-forwarding instead
       - Removes external load balancer cost and complexity
    3. **Kind Multi-Node Config**:
       - Simplify to single-node cluster (1 control-plane)
       - Sufficient for local development/testing
  - **What to Keep**:
    - All `replicas: 1` (already done) ✅
    - Single-node Kind cluster for local dev
    - Fixed-size EKS node group (1 node) for prod (if EKS still needed)
    - No load balancer (use NodePort/port-forwarding)
    - Security features: Rate limiting, circuit breakers ✅
- **Benefits of Simplification**:
  - ✅ **Lower Cost**: No load balancer, fewer nodes
  - ✅ **Easier Testing**: Single instance per service
  - ✅ **Less Maintenance**: No autoscaling to tune
  - ✅ **Simpler Debugging**: No multi-instance routing issues
  - ✅ **Still Functional**: Services work fine with single instances
- **Open Questions** (No decisions made):
  1. EKS node group: Keep fixed at 1 node, or remove EKS entirely and use Docker Compose only?
  2. Load balancer: Remove entirely, or keep for external access (if needed)?
  3. Kind config: Single-node or keep multi-node for learning?
- **Recommendation** (For Discussion):
  - Remove autoscaling and load balancer
  - Simplify Kind to single node
  - Keep EKS with fixed 1-node group if AWS deployment needed
  - Focus on security features rather than scalability
- **Files Affected** (If Implemented):
  - `terraform/eks.tf` - Remove/modify `scaling_config`, remove load balancer resources
  - `kubernetes/kind-config.yaml` - Simplify to single node
  - Documentation updates to reflect simplified architecture
- **Dependencies**: None (discussion only)
- **Estimated Time**: N/A (Discussion phase)
- **Why This Matters**: Aligns infrastructure with personal project goals: security-focused rather than scalability-focused. Reduces complexity, cost, and maintenance burden.

#### **INFRA-021: Simplify Kubernetes Configuration - Remove Dev/Prod Split**
- **Component**: Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Type**: Refactoring
- **Priority**: ⚠️ **MEDIUM** (Can Wait - Not Blocking Demo or Core Functionality)
- **Status**: 📋 **To Do**
- **Problem**: Kubernetes has separate dev/prod overlays, but only one unified Kubernetes configuration is needed
- **Goal**: Remove dev/prod distinction in Kubernetes, keep single unified Kubernetes config
- **Current State**:
  - **Docker (dev)**: Uses Redis (via docker-compose) and DynamoDB (AWS) - all basic infrastructure needed
  - **Kubernetes**: Needs full AWS infrastructure (VPC, EKS, DynamoDB, Redis) - currently has dev/prod split
  - **Terraform**: May not need changes (user confirmed)
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - **Kubernetes**:
    - Remove `kubernetes/prod/` directory completely
    - Consolidate `kubernetes/dev/` into single unified Kubernetes config (remove "dev" naming)
    - Single Kubernetes configuration that works for all Kubernetes deployments
    - No environment distinction (dev/prod) in Kubernetes manifests
    - All Kubernetes deployments use the same config
  - **Docker**:
    - Keep as is (already has Redis via docker-compose, uses DynamoDB)
    - No changes needed
  - **Terraform**:
    - May not need changes (check if current setup is sufficient)
  - Remove prod-specific configurations from scripts
  - Update documentation to reflect single Kubernetes config approach
- **Key Changes**:
  - `kubernetes/prod/`: Remove directory completely
  - `kubernetes/dev/`: Rename/consolidate to single config (e.g., `kubernetes/config/` or keep at `kubernetes/base/`)
  - `kubernetes/deploy.sh`: Remove prod branch, single Kubernetes deployment path
  - `scripts/config-loader.sh`: Remove prod environment configs for Kubernetes
  - Remove environment labels/annotations that distinguish dev/prod in Kubernetes manifests
- **Rationale**:
  - Docker is for local dev and already has all needed infrastructure (Redis in compose, DynamoDB)
  - Kubernetes deployment uses full AWS infrastructure but doesn't need separate dev/prod configs
  - Single Kubernetes config is simpler and sufficient for the project
- **Files to Update**:
  - `kubernetes/prod/` (remove directory)
  - `kubernetes/dev/` (consolidate to single unified config)
  - `kubernetes/base/` (may need updates if using base directly)
  - `kubernetes/deploy.sh` (remove prod branch)
  - `scripts/config-loader.sh` (remove prod Kubernetes configs)
  - `config/shared-config.yaml` (remove prod references)
  - Update relevant documentation


#### **ARCH-002: Evaluate and Optimize CORS Middleware Configuration**
- **Component**: Architecture & Middleware
- **Type**: Code Optimization
- **Priority**: 🔵 **LOW PRIORITY**
- **Status**: 📋 **To Do**
- **Problem**: CORS middleware exists in both Gateway (correct) and all backend services (redundant). Gateway is the single entry point, so services don't need CORS.
- **Goal**: Evaluate CORS configuration and remove redundant middleware from services
- **Current State**:
  - Gateway: Has CORS middleware ✅ (correct - single entry point)
  - Auth Service: Has CORS middleware (redundant - internal only)
  - User Service: Has CORS middleware (redundant - internal only)
  - Inventory Service: Has CORS middleware (redundant - internal only)
  - Order Service: Has CORS middleware (redundant - internal only)
- **Architecture Principle**:
  - Gateway is the single entry point for all external requests
  - Services are internal-only (not exposed externally)
  - Gateway handles CORS, so services don't need it
- **Evaluation Tasks**:
  - Review Gateway CORS configuration for correctness
  - Verify all services go through Gateway (no direct external access)
  - Document why CORS in services is redundant
- **Optimization Options**:
  - Option 1: Remove CORS from all services (simplest - recommended)
  - Option 2: Keep CORS in services but document it's redundant (defense-in-depth, but unnecessary)
- **Recommendation**: Remove CORS from services - Gateway already handles it
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Evaluation document created
  - Decision made (remove vs keep)
  - If removing: CORS middleware removed from all services
  - Gateway CORS configuration verified as correct
  - Documentation updated
- **Files to Evaluate**:
  - `gateway/internal/middleware/middleware.go` (CORS implementation)
  - `services/auth_service/src/main.py` (CORS middleware)
  - `services/user_service/src/main.py` (CORS middleware)
  - `services/inventory_service/src/main.py` (CORS middleware)
  - `services/order_service/src/main.py` (CORS middleware)
  - Architecture documentation

#### **CODE-002: BaseLogger JSON Logs Not Being Written to Files**
- **Component**: Logging & Observability
- **Type**: Bug Fix
- **Priority**: 🔵 **LOW PRIORITY**
- **Status**: 📋 **To Do**
- **Problem**: BaseLogger is configured to write JSON logs to `/var/log/services/{service}/` but files are not being created. Only Uvicorn HTTP access logs are visible.
- **Current Behavior**:
  - LOG_FILE_PATH environment variable is set to `/var/log`
  - Log directories are mounted: `./logs/{service}:/var/log/services/{service}`
  - BaseLogger initializes successfully but doesn't write log files
  - HTTP access logs work correctly (stdout)
- **Investigation Needed**:
  - Check if BaseLogger.log() method is being called
  - Verify file write permissions in containers
  - Check if log_to_file flag is properly set
  - Debug _write_to_file() method execution
- **Workaround**: HTTP access logs in Loki provide sufficient monitoring for now
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - JSON log files created in `/var/log/services/{service}/{service}.log`
  - Log files visible on host at `docker/logs/{service}/`
  - Promtail can read and send JSON logs to Loki
  - Application logs (login, register, errors) visible in Grafana
- **Files to Investigate**:
  - `services/common/src/shared/logging/base_logger.py`
  - `services/{service}/src/main.py` (logger initialization)
  - `docker/docker-compose.yml` (volume mounts, environment variables)
  - `monitoring/promtail/config.yml` (log file scraping)


#### **ARCH-003: Fix Route Configuration Disconnect** 🔵 **LOW PRIORITY**
- **Component**: Gateway Architecture
- **Type**: Refactoring
- **Priority**: 🔵 **LOW PRIORITY**
- **Status**: 📋 **To Do**
- **Problem**: Routes are registered statically in `setupRoutes()`, but auth/role checking happens later in `handleProxyRequest()`, creating a disconnect between route registration and route configuration
- **Goal**: Use route configs during route registration to ensure single source of truth and compile-time validation
- **Rationale**: Current implementation works fine with runtime checks, but using RouteConfigs during registration would improve maintainability
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Routes registered dynamically from `RouteConfigs`
  - Missing config = no route registered (compile-time validation)
  - Single source of truth for routes and their auth requirements
- **Files to Update**:
  - `gateway/internal/api/server.go` - Refactor `setupRoutes()` to use RouteConfigs
  - `gateway/pkg/constants/constants.go` - May need to adjust RouteConfigs structure for Gin routing
- **Note**: Low priority - current runtime validation is sufficient for personal project

#### **ARCH-004: Consider Proxy Service Refactoring** 🔵 **LOW PRIORITY**
- **Component**: Gateway Architecture
- **Type**: Code Organization
- **Priority**: 🔵 **LOW PRIORITY**
- **Status**: 📋 **To Do**
- **Problem**: ProxyService has multiple responsibilities (URL building, HTTP request creation, circuit breakers, route config lookups)
- **Goal**: Evaluate splitting ProxyService into separate concerns if code grows beyond manageable size
- **Rationale**: Current ~400 line file is manageable, but if it grows significantly, splitting would improve maintainability
- **Consider When**:
  - File exceeds ~800 lines
  - Need to test individual components in isolation
  - Multiple contributors working on Gateway
- **Potential Structure**:
  - URLBuilder - path transformations
  - RequestBuilder - HTTP request creation
  - CircuitBreakerManager - circuit breaker logic
  - ProxyService - orchestration only
- **Note**: Low priority - current structure works fine. Only refactor if it becomes a pain point.

#### **CODE-001: Clean Up TODOs and Known Bugs**
- **Component**: Code Quality
- **Type**: Maintenance
- **Priority**: 🔶 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Status**: 📋 **To Do**
- **Problem**: Several TODO comments and known bugs in codebase need to be addressed or documented
- **Goal**: Clean up TODOs and fix/document known bugs
- **Known Issues Found**:
  - TODO in `integration_tests/inventory_service/inventory_tests.py` (line 188): Asset deletion cleanup
  - BUG in `integration_tests/order_service/orders/get_order_tests.py`: Non-existent order returns 500 instead of 404
  - Debug function in `frontend/src/services/inventoryApi.ts`: `debugInfo()` method
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Review all TODO comments in codebase
  - Document or remove TODOs that are no longer relevant
  - Fix known bugs or add proper issue tracking
  - Remove debug functions or convert to proper logging
  - Update backlog with any new bugs found
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Use grep to find all TODOs/FIXMEs/BUGs in codebase
  - Prioritize based on impact
  - Fix bugs that are simple
  - Document complex issues in backlog
- **Files to Review**:
  - All Python service files
  - Frontend TypeScript files
  - Integration test files
  - Gateway Go files

#### **DOCS-002: Update Project Status Documentation Dates**
- **Component**: Documentation
- **Type**: Maintenance
- **Priority**: 🔵 **LOW PRIORITY**
- **Status**: 📋 **To Do**
- **Problem**: Some documentation has outdated dates.
- **Goal**: Update dates where needed; keep status in BACKLOG + README only.
- **Note**: `docs/project-status.md` was removed (duplicate of BACKLOG + README status).
- **Files to Update**:
  - `QUICK_START.md`: Update last updated date if needed
  - Review other docs for outdated timestamps
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Dates updated where relevant; status lives in BACKLOG and main README

#### **REVIEW-001: Evaluate All Tasks for Over-Engineering**
- **Component**: Project Management & Architecture
- **Type**: Review & Audit
- **Priority**: 🔶 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Status**: 📋 **To Do**
- **Problem**: Need to review all existing and planned tasks to ensure no over-engineering for a personal project with no traffic
- **Goal**: Identify and simplify any tasks that add unnecessary complexity
- **Review Criteria**:
  - Tasks should solve real problems, not hypothetical ones
  - Avoid enterprise-scale solutions for personal project needs
  - Keep implementations simple and maintainable
  - Remove features that won't be tested or used
  - Focus on learning value vs. unnecessary complexity
- **Review Process**:

### **🌐 Frontend & User Experience**


### **📊 Performance & Scaling**



### **🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance**

### **📦 Inventory & Asset Management**

---

## ⏸️ **DEFERRED / OUT OF SCOPE**

#### **FEATURE-001: Limit Order System** — Deferred
- **Status**: ⏸️ **SKIPPED** (not in current scope)
- **Summary**: Limit orders, auto price execution, and email notifications. Design doc: `docs/design-docs/limit-order-system-design.md`. Inventory already has continuous price sync and Redis PriceData; Terraform has PendingLimitOrders GSI. Remaining work (Balance held_balance, OrderDAO GSI methods, matching engine, email) deferred. Can be resumed later if needed.

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED TASKS**

#### **SEC-010: Incident Response — Failed-Login Runbook** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Component**: Security Operations / Documentation
- **Summary**: Runbook at `docs/runbooks/failed-login-burst.md`. Trigger: 5 failed logins from same IP in 1 day. Steps: verify (Loki/audit, gateway logs) → containment (auto-block or manual redis-cli SET ip_block:<ip>) → evidence → follow-up/review. References SEC-011, integration test, threat model. See DAILY_WORK_LOG.md.

#### **SEC-011: IP Block in Gateway (Auth Middleware + Auto-Block after 5 Failed Logins)** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Component**: Gateway (Go) / Security
- **Summary**: Gateway auth middleware checks Redis `ip_block:<ip>` before token validation; blocked IPs get 403. Gateway records failed logins (401 from POST /auth/login) and sets `ip_block:<ip>` after 5 failures in a 1-day window (TTL 5 min dev / configurable). Integration tests (`integration_tests/incident/test_ip_block.py`) verify full flow: init → 5 wrong logins → 6th request 403 → wait 5 min → login works again.
- **Details**: See DAILY_WORK_LOG.md

#### **CNY-001: Chinese New Year Secret (Full Stack)** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Component**: Frontend + User Service + Gateway
- **Summary**: Hidden 🧧 trigger in Dashboard footer; modal for secret phrase; `POST /api/v1/cny/claim`; big/small red pocket images (`bigrpocket.jpg`, `littleredpocket.jpg`); amount at bottom. Backend: config `cny_phrases.json`, one red pocket per user per day. See DAILY_WORK_LOG.md for details.

#### **DEV-003: Local Deploy with Local DB** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Component**: Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Summary**: One-command local deploy via `./docker/deploy.sh local deploy`. LocalStack (DynamoDB) + Redis + all services. Integration tests passed. Frontend order 422 fix deferred to later.
- **Details**: See DAILY_WORK_LOG.md

#### **FEATURE-002.1: Insights Caching** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Component**: Insights Service
- **Summary**: Implemented in-memory cache for Gemini portfolio insights with 24-hour TTL. Portfolio hash generation, cache check/save logic in `insights_cache.py`, controller integration, and unit tests for cache hit/miss. Simplified approach instead of DynamoDB; design doc describes DynamoDB option for future scaling.
- **Details**: See DAILY_WORK_LOG.md

#### **BUG-002: Fix Rate Limit Headers Overwritten During Proxy Response** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: 🔥 **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Summary**: Fixed rate limit headers being overwritten when gateway proxies backend responses. Modified `gateway/internal/api/server.go` to preserve rate limit headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`) after copying backend response headers. Headers now take precedence over backend headers. Fix applied and ready for gateway redeployment. See `integration_tests/load_tests/TEST_REPORT_20260205.md` for details.

#### **TEST-002: Implement Load Testing for Security Feature Validation** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: 🔥 **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Summary**: Successfully implemented and executed load testing suite for security feature validation. All 6 core test cases implemented (Rate Limiting, Circuit Breakers, Lock Management, Latency). Tests executed successfully with all core functionality validated. Identified and fixed BUG-002 (rate limit headers). Updated rate limit configurations to realistic production values (Gateway: 10,000 req/min, Services: 3,000-7,500 req/min). Optimized test configurations to reduce memory usage by ~90%. Created comprehensive test report documenting all results. See `integration_tests/load_tests/TEST_REPORT_20260205.md` for full details.

#### **ARCH-001: Implement Service-Level Request Context Handling** ✅ **NOT NEEDED**
- **Component**: Architecture & Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Priority**: 🔶 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
