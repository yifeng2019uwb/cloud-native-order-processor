#### **INFRA-021: Simplify Kubernetes Configuration - Remove Dev/Prod Split**
- **Component**: Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Type**: Refactoring
- **Priority**: üî• **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Status**: üìã **To Do**
- **Problem**: Kubernetes has separate dev/prod overlays, but only one unified Kubernetes configuration is needed
- **Goal**: Remove dev/prod distinction in Kubernetes, keep single unified Kubernetes config
- **Current State**:
  - **Docker (dev)**: Uses Redis (via docker-compose) and DynamoDB (AWS) - all basic infrastructure needed
  - **Kubernetes**: Needs full AWS infrastructure (VPC, EKS, DynamoDB, Redis) - currently has dev/prod split
  - **Terraform**: May not need changes (user confirmed)
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - **Kubernetes**:
    - Remove `kubernetes/prod/` directory completely
    - Consolidate `kubernetes/dev/` into single unified Kubernetes config (remove "dev" naming)
    - Single Kubernetes configuration that works for all Kubernetes deployments
    - No environment distinction (dev/prod) in Kubernetes manifests
    - All Kubernetes deployments use the same config
  - **Docker**:
    - Keep as is (already has Redis via docker-compose, uses DynamoDB)
    - No changes needed
  - **Terraform**:
    - May not need changes (check if current setup is sufficient)
  - Remove prod-specific configurations from scripts
  - Update documentation to reflect single Kubernetes config approach
- **Key Changes**:
  - `kubernetes/prod/`: Remove directory completely
  - `kubernetes/dev/`: Rename/consolidate to single config (e.g., `kubernetes/config/` or keep at `kubernetes/base/`)
  - `kubernetes/deploy.sh`: Remove prod branch, single Kubernetes deployment path
  - `scripts/config-loader.sh`: Remove prod environment configs for Kubernetes
  - Remove environment labels/annotations that distinguish dev/prod in Kubernetes manifests
- **Rationale**:
  - Docker is for local dev and already has all needed infrastructure (Redis in compose, DynamoDB)
  - Kubernetes deployment uses full AWS infrastructure but doesn't need separate dev/prod configs
  - Single Kubernetes config is simpler and sufficient for the project
- **Files to Update**:
  - `kubernetes/prod/` (remove directory)
  - `kubernetes/dev/` (consolidate to single unified config)
  - `kubernetes/base/` (may need updates if using base directly)
  - `kubernetes/deploy.sh` (remove prod branch)
  - `scripts/config-loader.sh` (remove prod Kubernetes configs)
  - `config/shared-config.yaml` (remove prod references)
  - Update relevant documentation


#### **SEC-008: Security Architecture Evaluation** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Component**: Security & Architecture
- **Type**: Audit & Design Review
- **Priority**: üî• **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Summary**: Comprehensive security audit completed. Found XSS protection already implemented via input sanitization. Identified 2 essential fixes (CORS, secret fallbacks) and 2 optional verifications. Security rating: 8/10 - excellent for personal project.
- **Key Findings**:
  - ‚úÖ **XSS protection implemented** - HTML tag sanitization + suspicious pattern detection
  - ‚úÖ Strong authentication, password security, input validation
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è CORS too permissive in Inventory Service (essential fix)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Development secret fallbacks should be removed (essential fix)
  - ‚ö™ Frontend token storage needs quick review (optional)
  - ‚ùå HTTP security headers not needed (XSS already handled)
- **Deliverables**:
  - Security audit document: `docs/design-docs/security-audit.md`
- **Next Steps**: Implement SEC-009 (Essential Security Fixes)

#### **SEC-009: Remove Gateway JWT Secret & Verify No Secrets Exposed**
- **Component**: Security & Code Cleanup
- **Type**: Code Cleanup & Verification
- **Priority**: üî∂ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Status**: üìã **To Do**
- **Problem**: Gateway has unused JWT secret (dead code) that should be removed for code cleanliness
- **Goal**: Remove Gateway JWT secret (dead code) and verify no secrets/configs are exposed in public repo
- **Analysis**: See `docs/design-docs/SEC-009-analysis.md` for detailed analysis
- **Key Findings**:
  - ‚úÖ **Service fallback secrets are ACCEPTABLE** - docker-compose.yml not in public repo (gitignored)
  - ‚ö™ **Gateway JWT secret is unused** (dead code) - should be removed for code cleanliness
  - ‚úÖ **No security risk** - Gateway doesn't use JWT secret (delegates to Auth Service)
- **Tasks Required**:
  1. **Remove Gateway JWT Secret** (Code Cleanup):
     - Remove `JWTConfig` from `gateway/internal/config/config.go`
     - Remove `DefaultJWTSecretKey` constant from `gateway/pkg/constants/constants.go`
     - Update Gateway config tests if they reference JWT config
  2. **Verify No Secrets in Public Repo** (Security Verification):
     - Verify `docker/docker-compose.yml` is gitignored ‚úÖ (already confirmed)
     - Verify K8s secrets are gitignored ‚úÖ (already confirmed)
     - Verify `.env` files are gitignored ‚úÖ (already confirmed)
     - Scan public repo for any hardcoded secrets
     - Ensure `gateway/pkg/constants/constants.go` has no secrets after cleanup
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Gateway JWT secret removed (JWTConfig, DefaultJWTSecretKey)
  - Gateway config tests updated (if needed)
  - Verified no secrets/configs exposed in public repo
  - All sensitive files confirmed in `.gitignore`
- **Files to Update**:
  - `gateway/internal/config/config.go` (remove JWTConfig)
  - `gateway/pkg/constants/constants.go` (remove DefaultJWTSecretKey)
  - `gateway/internal/config/config_test.go` (update tests if needed)
- **Files NOT to Update** (Per Analysis):
  - `docker/docker-compose.yml` - Keep fallback secrets (not in public repo, acceptable for local dev)
  - Service code - Service fallback secrets are acceptable
- **Security Impact**:
  - **Before**: Gateway has unused JWT secret in public repo (dead code)
  - **After**: Gateway JWT secret removed, no secrets exposed in public repo
- **Note**: Service fallback secrets in docker-compose.yml are acceptable since file is not in public repo. For production, repo should not be public and should use proper secrets (K8s secrets, environment variables).
- **Related**: See detailed analysis in `docs/design-docs/SEC-009-analysis.md`

#### **ARCH-002: Evaluate and Optimize CORS Middleware Configuration**
- **Component**: Architecture & Middleware
- **Type**: Code Optimization
- **Priority**: üîµ **LOW PRIORITY**
- **Status**: üìã **To Do**
- **Problem**: CORS middleware exists in both Gateway (correct) and all backend services (redundant). Gateway is the single entry point, so services don't need CORS.
- **Goal**: Evaluate CORS configuration and remove redundant middleware from services
- **Current State**:
  - Gateway: Has CORS middleware ‚úÖ (correct - single entry point)
  - Auth Service: Has CORS middleware (redundant - internal only)
  - User Service: Has CORS middleware (redundant - internal only)
  - Inventory Service: Has CORS middleware (redundant - internal only)
  - Order Service: Has CORS middleware (redundant - internal only)
- **Architecture Principle**:
  - Gateway is the single entry point for all external requests
  - Services are internal-only (not exposed externally)
  - Gateway handles CORS, so services don't need it
- **Evaluation Tasks**:
  - Review Gateway CORS configuration for correctness
  - Verify all services go through Gateway (no direct external access)
  - Document why CORS in services is redundant
- **Optimization Options**:
  - Option 1: Remove CORS from all services (simplest - recommended)
  - Option 2: Keep CORS in services but document it's redundant (defense-in-depth, but unnecessary)
- **Recommendation**: Remove CORS from services - Gateway already handles it
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Evaluation document created
  - Decision made (remove vs keep)
  - If removing: CORS middleware removed from all services
  - Gateway CORS configuration verified as correct
  - Documentation updated
- **Files to Evaluate**:
  - `gateway/internal/middleware/middleware.go` (CORS implementation)
  - `services/auth_service/src/main.py` (CORS middleware)
  - `services/user_service/src/main.py` (CORS middleware)
  - `services/inventory_service/src/main.py` (CORS middleware)
  - `services/order_service/src/main.py` (CORS middleware)
  - Architecture documentation

## **üîÑ CURRENT TASKS**

#### **AUTH-008: Simplify Authentication Architecture** üî• **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Problem**: Current architecture mixes JWT validation (auth service) with gateway headers (order/user services), creating complexity and inconsistency
- **Goal**: Standardize on JWT validation across all services, remove unnecessary HeaderValidator and gateway header complexity
- **Steps**:
  1. **Refactor order service** to use JWT validation instead of gateway headers
  2. **Refactor user service** to use JWT validation instead of gateway headers
  3. **Remove HeaderValidator** from common module (unnecessary complexity)
  4. **Update all service dependencies** to use simple JWT token validation
  5. **Remove gateway header validation** from all services
  6. **Test all services** to ensure JWT validation works correctly
- **Benefits**: Simpler architecture, standard practice, easier maintenance, no over-engineering
