## 📝 **Quick Decision Log Template**
*For smaller decisions that don't need full template*

| Date | Component | Decision | Why | Impact | Status |
|------|-----------|----------|-----|---------|---------|
| 8/6 | API Models | Consolidate files | Better organization | Low | ✅ Done |
| 8/7 | Order Entity | Change SK to ORDER | Better GSI queries | Medium | 🔄 In Progress |
| [Date] | [Component] | [Decision] | [Why] | [Impact] | [Status] |

**Status Indicators:**
- ✅ **Done** - Decision implemented and working
- 🔄 **In Progress** - Decision made, implementation ongoing
- 📋 **Planned** - Decision made, not yet started
- ❌ **Rejected** - Decision was made but later rejected
- 🔍 **Under Review** - Decision being reconsidered

## 🎯 **How to Use This Template**

### **Before Starting Development:**
1. **Create Design Doc**: Use the template above
2. **Research Options**: Consider multiple approaches
3. **Document Trade-offs**: Clearly list pros and cons
4. **Make Decision**: Document your choice and rationale

### **During Development:**
1. **Update Design Doc**: Add implementation details
2. **Document Changes**: Track any design modifications
3. **Note Issues**: Document problems and solutions

### **After Completion:**
1. **Review Design**: Compare planned vs. actual implementation
2. **Document Lessons**: What worked, what didn't

## 📊 **Design Quality Checklist**

### **Self-Review Questions:**
- [ ] **Problem Clear**: Is the problem well-defined?
- [ ] **Options Explored**: Did you consider multiple approaches?
- [ ] **Trade-offs Documented**: Are pros and cons clearly listed?
- [ ] **Decision Rationale**: Is the reasoning clear and complete?
- [ ] **Implementation Plan**: Is the approach feasible?
