## 📋 Document Overview

**Document Type**: Architecture Design Document
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-08-20
**Status**: Draft
**Author**: Cloud Native Order Processor Team

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for implementing centralized authentication in the Cloud Native Order Processor system. The architecture centralizes all JWT validation and user authentication at the Gateway level, eliminating the need for individual backend services to validate JWT tokens.

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

### High-Level Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   External      │    │     Gateway     │    │   Backend       │
│   Clients       │───▶│   (Auth Layer)  │───▶│   Services      │
│                 │    │                 │    │                 │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Key Principles

1. **Single Authentication Boundary**: Gateway handles all external authentication
2. **Trusted Internal Communication**: Backend services trust Gateway completely
3. **No JWT Secret Distribution**: Only Gateway possesses JWT validation secrets
4. **Network Isolation**: Backend services are not directly accessible externally

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### 1. Client Request Processing

#### External Request
- Client sends HTTP request with `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`
- Request is routed to Gateway (no direct backend access possible)
- Gateway becomes the single entry point for all external traffic

#### JWT Validation
- Gateway validates JWT token using its configured JWT secret
- Gateway extracts user information from JWT claims:
  - Username
  - Role
  - Permissions
  - Token expiration
- If validation fails, Gateway returns 401 Unauthorized

### 2. Gateway Processing

#### User Context Extraction
- Username from JWT `sub` claim
- Role from JWT `role` claim
- Authentication status (authenticated/unauthenticated)
- Token metadata (creation time, expiration)

#### Security Header Injection
Gateway adds the following headers to all forwarded requests:
- `X-Source: gateway` - Proves request came through Gateway
- `X-User-ID: <username>` - Extracted username
- `X-User-Role: <role>` - Extracted user role
- `X-Authenticated: true` - Authentication status
- `X-Request-ID: <uuid>` - Request tracking

#### Request Routing
- Gateway determines target backend service based on URL path
- Gateway forwards request with all original headers + security headers
- Gateway maintains request/response correlation

### 3. Backend Service Processing

#### Source Validation
- Backend service validates `X-Source: gateway` header
- Rejects any request without this header (security measure)
- Only processes requests from trusted Gateway

#### User Context Extraction
- Backend extracts user information from Gateway headers
- No JWT parsing or validation required
- User context available for business logic decisions

#### Business Logic Execution
- Service executes business logic based on user context
- Permission checks based on Gateway-provided user role
- Audit logging using Gateway-provided user information

## 🛡️ Security Model

### Network Security

#### External Access Control
- **Gateway**: Exposed to external network (ports 8080/30002)
- **Backend Services**: Internal network only (no external ports)
- **Load Balancer**: Routes all external traffic to Gateway

#### Internal Network Isolation
- Backend services communicate via Kubernetes internal network
- Services are not accessible from external networks
- Gateway acts as reverse proxy and security boundary

### Trust Model

#### Gateway Trust
- Backend services trust Gateway completely
- Gateway is the single source of truth for authentication
- No verification of Gateway's authentication decisions

#### Request Source Validation
- Backend services validate `X-Source: gateway` header
- Reject requests without proper source identification
- Prevent bypass of Gateway security

### Authentication Boundaries

#### External → Gateway
- JWT token validation
- User context extraction
- Security policy enforcement

#### Gateway → Backend
- Trusted internal communication
- Security header injection
- Request forwarding

#### Backend → Backend (if needed)
- Direct service-to-service communication
- May require internal service mesh authentication
- Separate from external authentication flow

## 🔧 Service Responsibilities

### Gateway Service

#### Authentication Responsibilities
- JWT token validation and parsing
- User context extraction and enrichment
- Security policy enforcement (roles, permissions)
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

#### Request Processing
- Request routing to backend services
- Header manipulation and security injection
- Request/response correlation
- Error handling and logging

#### Security Features
- CORS policy enforcement
- Request sanitization
- Audit logging
- Security header management

### Backend Services

#### Authentication Responsibilities
- **None** - No JWT validation required
- Source validation (`X-Source: gateway`)
- User context extraction from Gateway headers

#### Business Logic
- Core business functionality
- Permission-based access control
- User context utilization
- Audit trail maintenance

#### Security Features
- Source header validation
- User context verification
- Business-level permission checks

### User Service (Special Case)

#### JWT Token Creation
- Creates JWT tokens for user login/registration
- Uses same JWT secret as Gateway (for token creation only)
- No JWT validation for incoming requests

#### Authentication Flow
- Receives login/registration requests via Gateway
- Validates user credentials
- Creates JWT tokens with appropriate claims
- Returns tokens to client through Gateway

## 📊 Data Flow Examples

### 1. User Registration and Login

```
1. Client → Gateway → User Service (Registration)
   - User Service creates user account
   - Returns success response

2. Client → Gateway → User Service (Login)
   - User Service validates credentials
   - User Service creates JWT token using shared secret
   - JWT token returned to client via Gateway
```

### 2. Protected API Access

```
1. Client → Gateway (with JWT token)
   - Gateway validates JWT token
   - Gateway extracts user context
   - Gateway adds security headers

2. Gateway → Backend Service
   - Backend validates X-Source: gateway
   - Backend extracts user context from headers
   - Backend executes business logic
   - Backend returns response via Gateway

3. Gateway → Client
   - Gateway forwards backend response
   - Maintains response headers and status
```

### 3. Service-to-Service Communication

```
1. Service A → Service B (internal)
   - May require internal authentication
   - Separate from external JWT flow
   - Uses internal service mesh or direct calls

2. External Client → Gateway → Service A → Service B
   - Gateway handles external authentication
   - Internal calls use Gateway-provided context
   - No additional authentication required
```
