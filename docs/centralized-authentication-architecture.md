#### Request Flow:
1. **Client → Gateway**: External request with JWT token
2. **Gateway → Auth Service**: Forward for JWT validation
3. **Auth Service → Gateway**: Return user context and authentication result
4. **Gateway → Backend**: Forward request with security headers
5. **Backend → Gateway**: Return business logic response
6. **Gateway → Client**: Forward response to client

#### Key Architecture Principles:
- **Gateway**: Single entry point, handles routing and forwarding
- **Auth Service**: Dedicated authentication and authorization
- **Backend Services**: Business logic only, no JWT validation
- **Internal Network**: All services communicate via Kubernetes internal network
- **Security Headers**: Gateway injects security context from Auth Service

### Key Principles

1. **Dedicated Authentication Service**: Auth Service handles all JWT validation and user authentication
2. **Gateway as Router**: Gateway focuses on routing and request forwarding, not authentication logic
3. **Trusted Internal Communication**: Backend services trust Auth Service completely
4. **No JWT Secret Distribution**: Only Auth Service possesses JWT validation secrets
5. **Network Isolation**: Backend services are not directly accessible externally
6. **Future RBAC Ready**: Architecture designed to support Role-Based Access Control

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### 1. Client Request Processing

#### External Request
- Client sends HTTP request with `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`
- Request is routed to Gateway (no direct backend access possible)
- Gateway becomes the single entry point for all external traffic

#### Request Routing
- Gateway receives request and forwards to **Auth Service** for authentication
- Gateway maintains request/response correlation
- Gateway handles routing decisions based on Auth Service response

### 2. Auth Service Processing

#### JWT Validation
- **Auth Service** validates JWT token using its configured JWT secret
- **Auth Service** extracts user information from JWT claims:
  - Username
  - Role
  - Permissions
  - Token expiration
- If validation fails, Auth Service returns authentication error

#### User Context Extraction
- Username from JWT `sub` claim
- Role from JWT `role` claim
- Authentication status (authenticated/unauthenticated)
- Token metadata (creation time, expiration)
- Future: RBAC permissions and access control

#### Authentication Response
- **Auth Service** returns authentication result to Gateway
- Includes user context and authentication status
- May include authorization decisions for specific endpoints

### 3. Gateway Processing

#### Authentication Integration
- Gateway receives authentication result from Auth Service
- Gateway adds security headers based on Auth Service response
- **Gateway forwards request to appropriate backend service**

#### Security Header Injection
Gateway adds the following headers to all forwarded requests:
- `X-Source: gateway` - Proves request came through Gateway
- `X-Auth-Service: auth-service` - Proves authentication was handled by Auth Service
- `X-User-ID: <username>` - Extracted username from Auth Service
- `X-User-Role: <role>` - Extracted user role from Auth Service
- `X-Authenticated: true` - Authentication status from Auth Service
- `X-Request-ID: <uuid>` - Request tracking
- `X-Auth-Token: <token-id>` - Authentication token reference

#### Request Routing
- **Gateway determines target backend service** based on URL path
- **Gateway forwards request** with all original headers + security headers
- **Gateway maintains request/response correlation**
- **Gateway handles response forwarding** back to client

### 4. Backend Service Processing

#### Source Validation
- Backend service validates `X-Source: gateway` header
- Backend service validates `X-Auth-Service: auth-service` header
- Rejects any request without proper source identification
- Only processes requests from trusted Gateway and Auth Service

#### User Context Extraction
- Backend extracts user information from Gateway headers
- No JWT parsing or validation required
- User context available for business logic decisions

#### Business Logic Execution
- Service executes business logic based on user context
- Permission checks based on Auth Service-provided user role
- Audit logging using Auth Service-provided user information

## 🛡️ Security Model

### Network Security

#### External Access Control
- **Gateway**: Exposed to external network (ports 8080/30002)
- **Auth Service**: Internal network only (no external ports)
- **Backend Services**: Internal network only (no external ports)
- **Load Balancer**: Routes all external traffic to Gateway

#### Internal Network Isolation
- Auth Service and backend services communicate via Kubernetes internal network
- Services are not accessible from external networks
- Gateway and Auth Service act as security boundary

#### Network-Level Security Controls

##### Kubernetes Network Policies
```yaml
# Backend services only accept requests from internal network
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: backend-services-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend-service
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: internal-services
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: gateway
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: auth-service
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8000  # Backend service port
```

##### Service Configuration
- **Backend Services**: Bind only to internal Kubernetes cluster IPs
- **No External Load Balancers**: Services not exposed via LoadBalancer type
- **Internal Port Binding**: Services listen only on internal cluster ports
- **NodePort Restrictions**: No NodePort exposure for backend services

##### IP Whitelisting
- **Internal Cluster IPs**: Only accept requests from Kubernetes cluster IP range
- **Gateway IPs**: Whitelist Gateway service IPs
- **Auth Service IPs**: Whitelist Auth Service IPs
- **Reject External IPs**: Block all requests from external IP addresses

##### Port Security
- **Backend Service Ports**: Only listen on internal cluster ports (8000, 8001, 8002)
- **No External Port Mapping**: No port forwarding to external interfaces
- **Internal Service Discovery**: Use Kubernetes internal service names for communication

### Trust Model

#### Auth Service Trust
- **Gateway** trusts Auth Service for all authentication decisions
- **Backend services** trust Gateway and Auth Service completely
- **Auth Service** is the single source of truth for authentication

#### Request Source Validation
- Backend services validate both `X-Source: gateway` and `X-Auth-Service: auth-service` headers
- Reject requests without proper source identification
- Prevent bypass of security layers

### Authentication Boundaries

#### External → Gateway
- Request routing and forwarding
- Security header management
- Response handling

#### Gateway → Auth Service
- Authentication requests
- JWT validation requests
- User context retrieval

#### Gateway → Backend
- Trusted internal communication
- Security header injection
- Request forwarding

#### Backend → Backend (if needed)
- Direct service-to-service communication
- May require internal service mesh authentication
- Separate from external authentication flow

## 🔧 Service Responsibilities

### Common Package Architecture

## 🚦 Rate Limiting & Circuit Breaker Patterns

### Rate Limiting Strategy

#### Auth Service Rate Limiting
- **Per-IP Rate Limiting**: Limit authentication attempts per client IP
- **Per-User Rate Limiting**: Limit login attempts per username
- **Global Rate Limiting**: Protect against distributed attacks
- **Burst Handling**: Allow reasonable burst traffic while preventing abuse

#### Rate Limiting Implementation
```yaml
# Redis-based rate limiting configuration
rate_limits:
  auth_service:
    per_ip: 100 requests/minute
    per_user: 5 login attempts/minute
    global: 1000 requests/minute
    burst: 200 requests
  gateway:
    per_ip: 1000 requests/minute
    per_user: 100 requests/minute
    global: 10000 requests/minute
    burst: 1000 requests
```

#### Rate Limiting Headers
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Request limit per time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time until rate limit resets
- `Retry-After`: Suggested retry delay when rate limited

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

#### Auth Service Circuit Breaker
- **Failure Threshold**: Number of failures before opening circuit
- **Timeout**: Time to wait before attempting to close circuit
- **Half-Open State**: Allow limited requests to test recovery
- **Fallback Strategy**: Handle auth failures gracefully

#### Circuit Breaker States
```
CLOSED (Normal) → OPEN (Failing) → HALF-OPEN (Testing) → CLOSED (Recovered)
     ↓                ↓                ↓
  Auth Service   Auth Service    Limited Auth    Auth Service
  Working       Unavailable     Requests        Working Again
```

#### Circuit Breaker Configuration
```yaml
circuit_breaker:
  auth_service:
    failure_threshold: 5 failures
    timeout: 30 seconds
    half_open_requests: 3
    fallback_strategy: "reject_with_503"
  gateway:
    failure_threshold: 3 failures
    timeout: 15 seconds
    half_open_requests: 2
    fallback_strategy: "cached_auth_result"
```

### Resilience Patterns

#### Gateway Resilience
- **Auth Service Failover**: Multiple Auth Service instances
- **Cached Authentication**: Cache recent auth results for resilience
- **Degraded Mode**: Allow limited functionality when Auth Service is down

#### Backend Service Resilience
- **Request Queuing**: Queue requests when Gateway is overwhelmed
- **Timeout Handling**: Implement request timeouts to prevent hanging
- **Retry Logic**: Retry failed requests with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provide limited functionality during outages
