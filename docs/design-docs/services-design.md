# 🐍 Services Design

## 🎯 **Purpose**
Document design decisions, options considered, and rationale for the microservices architecture to prevent re-designing and maintain consistency.

## 📋 **Component Design: Microservices Architecture**
**Date**: 2025-08-20
**Author**: System Design Team
**Status**: Completed

#### **🎯 Problem Statement**
- **Problem**: Need scalable, maintainable backend services for trading platform
- **Requirements**: User authentication, order processing, asset management, balance operations
- **Constraints**: Python ecosystem, AWS integration, cost efficiency, rapid development

#### **🔍 Options Considered**

- **Option A: Monolithic Architecture**
  - ✅ Pros: Simple deployment, shared code, easy debugging
  - ❌ Cons: Tight coupling, difficult scaling, single point of failure
  - 💰 Cost: Low initial cost, high long-term cost
  - ⏱️ Complexity: Low complexity, high maintenance

- **Option B: Microservices with FastAPI (Chosen)**
  - ✅ Pros: Independent scaling, technology flexibility, team autonomy
  - ❌ Cons: More complex deployment, network overhead, distributed debugging
  - 💰 Cost: Medium initial cost, low long-term cost
  - ⏱️ Complexity: Medium complexity, low maintenance

- **Option C: Serverless Functions (Lambda)**
  - ✅ Pros: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use, managed infrastructure
  - ❌ Cons: Cold start latency, vendor lock-in, limited execution time
  - 💰 Cost: High cost for high traffic, low cost for low traffic
  - ⏱️ Complexity: Low complexity, high vendor dependency

#### **🏗️ Final Decision**
- **Chosen Option**: FastAPI-based microservices with shared common package
- **Rationale**: Perfect balance of performance, flexibility, and maintainability
- **Trade-offs Accepted**: More complex deployment for better scalability and team autonomy

#### **🔧 Implementation Details**

**Key Components**:
- **User Service**: Authentication, profile management, balance operations
- **Order Service**: Order processing, trading operations, portfolio management
- **Inventory Service**: Asset catalog, pricing data, public inventory access
- **Common Package**: Shared entities, DAOs, security, and utilities
- **Exception Package**: Standardized error handling with RFC 7807

**Data Structures**:
- **User Entities**: User, Balance, BalanceTransaction
- **Order Entities**: Order, OrderCreate, OrderResponse
- **Asset Entities**: Asset, AssetBalance, AssetTransaction
- **Shared Models**: Pydantic-based validation and serialization

**Configuration**:
- **Environment Variables**: Service URLs, database connections, JWT secrets
- **Service Discovery**: API Gateway-based routing and load balancing
- **Database**: DynamoDB with single-table design per service

#### **🧪 Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with mocking
- **Integration Tests**: Service-to-service communication validation
- **API Tests**: Endpoint functionality and error handling
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow validation

#### **📝 Notes & Future Considerations**
- **Known Limitations**: Network latency between services, distributed debugging complexity
- **Future Improvements**: Service mesh, advanced monitoring, caching layer
