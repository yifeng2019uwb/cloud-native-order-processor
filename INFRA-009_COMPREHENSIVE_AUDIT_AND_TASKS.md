# INFRA-009: Comprehensive Service Architecture Optimization

## 🎯 **Overview**
This document tracks the remaining service architecture optimization and modernization tasks across all services and modules.

---

## 🚧 **PENDING TASKS**

### **Service-Specific Hardcoded Values** 📋 **PENDING**
- ❌ **User Service**: Still has hardcoded strings in controllers, API models, and validation files (28 files with hardcoded values)
- ❌ **Order Service**: Still has hardcoded strings in controllers and API models (17 files with hardcoded values)
- ❌ **Auth Service**: Still has hardcoded strings in controllers and API models (10 files with hardcoded values)
- ❌ **Inventory Service**: Still has hardcoded strings in controllers and API models
- ❌ **Gateway Service**: Still has hardcoded strings in Go code

### **Service Integration Updates** 📋 **PENDING**
- ❌ **Update Service Usage**: Update services to use new `TransactionResult` fields
- ❌ **Service-Specific Constants**: Create service-specific constant files where needed
- ❌ **Import Path Standardization**: Fix remaining circular import issues across services

### **Architecture Modernization** 📋 **PENDING**
- ❌ **PynamoDB Migration**: Migrate remaining services from boto3 to PynamoDB
- ❌ **Async/Sync Documentation**: Create comprehensive guidelines for async/sync patterns
- ❌ **Error Handling**: Standardize error handling with typed exceptions across all services
- ❌ **Logging Standardization**: Implement structured logging with consistent field names across all services
- ❌ **Dependency Modernization**: Update all services to latest stable versions
- ❌ **Pydantic-First Approach**: Replace hardcoded JSON with Pydantic models
- ❌ **Advanced Patterns**: Implement dependency injection, factory patterns, builders
